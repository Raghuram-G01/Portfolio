                    Hello! I'm Raghuram, a dedicated developer with a strong background in programming and problem-solving. 
                    I am currently studying at Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, where I have developed a deep interest in software development 
                    and enhanced my technical skills. Proficient in C, C++, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I offer versatility 
                    as a full-stack developer.
                </p>
                <p class="aboutme">
                    I specialize in developing efficient solutions, writing clean and maintainable code, and working collaboratively in team environments. 
                    My key strengths include a keen eye for detail, creativity, and a dedication to continuous learning. 
                    While I may need some time to adjust to new settings, I tackle challenges with determination and a commitment to excellence.
